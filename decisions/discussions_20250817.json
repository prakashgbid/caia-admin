Found excellent GitHub coverage with all major projects having active repositories, strong documentation in most projects, but some gaps in professional elements like CONTRIBUTING.md files in newer projects.",

    "summary": "Audited all projects for GitHub presence, documentation quality, and professional elements. Found 15 GitHub repos, 8/9 with excellent presence. Key gaps: No GitHub Wikis enabled, only 1/7 has GitHub Pages deployed, no npm packages published (but 3 PyPI packages live). Missing LICENSE files in 3 projects, missing CONTRIBUTING.md in 5 projects. Overall strong foundation with room for professional polish.",
